## Project Description
This project aims to use **AI and Data Science** for recognizing and classifying different animals. The system implements machine learning models to detect, classify, and analyze animals from images or videos.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AIDataScience-AnimalRecognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AIDataScience-AnimalRecognition
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, use the following commands to start the application:

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Use with input images:
    ```bash
    python main.py --input your-animal-image.jpg
    ```

3. If using pre-trained models, make sure to place them in the `models/` directory before running the program.

## Features
- **Animal Detection**: Detect animals from images or video files.
- **Species Classification**: Classify detected animals into specific species.
- **Image Processing**: Perform preprocessing tasks to clean and prepare images for model input.
- **Model Training**: Includes functionality for training custom models on new datasets.
  
## Technologies
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
