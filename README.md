## Project Description
This project aims to use **AI and Data Science** for recognizing and classifying different animals. The system implements machine learning models to detect, classify, and analyze animals from images.


## Features
- **Animal Detection**: Detect animals from images or video files.
- **Species Classification**: Classify detected animals into specific species.
- **Image Processing**: Perform preprocessing tasks to clean and prepare images for model input.
- **Model Training**: Includes functionality for training custom models on new datasets.
  
## Technologies
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
